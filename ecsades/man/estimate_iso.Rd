\title{Estimating the isodensity contours}
\usage{
estimate_iso(obj, output_rp, n_point = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{the fitted joint distribution object as generated by function \code{\link{fit_ht}}
or \code{\link{fit_wln}}.  See details.}

\item{output_rp}{the required return periods (in years) for the estimated contours. Note that return periods
that are substantially larger than the data coverage may lead to a long processing time}

\item{n_point}{the number of points to output around each contour. The default value is 100.}
}
\value{
A set of estimated environmental contours with the specified return periods in the format
of a \code{data.table} with \code{rp}, \code{hs}, and \code{tp} as columns.
}
\description{
This function estimates the isodensity environmental contours for a fitted joint distribution of
class \code{ht} or \code{wln}.
}
\details{
The estimated contour for a given return period \code{rp} is a set of points with constant joint
probability density, equal to that at the anchor point.  The anchor point for the \eqn{K}-year return
period is the \eqn{K}-year return level on wave height \code{hs}, and the conditional median of
the wave period \code{tp}. See the guidance by DNV-GL section 3.7.2.

Due to the challenge of the non-parametric estimation of a joint denisty, the current version only
supports joint probability density estimation based on
the parametric form of the Weibull-log-normal model or the parametric part of the Heffernan-Tawn
model.  In particular, the residual distribution in the Heffernan-Tawn is approximted by a normal
distribution, rather than estimated using the kernel density.

For this same reason, the isodensity contour the function does not currently support inputs of
original sample data like the other contour estimation functions in this package.  Also when applied
to a Heffernan-Tawn \code{ht} class object, the quadrant below the dependence thresholds is ignored.

The users are always encouraged to choose a suitable joint distribution using \code{fit_ht} or
\code{fit_wln} and estimate the isodensity contours based on the fitted distribution.

# Load data
data(ww3_pk)
data(ww3_ts)

# Draw isodensity contours using a ht fit on the full time series data
ht = fit_ht(data = ww3_ts, npy = nrow(ww3_ts)/10, 100, 500)
iso_ts = estimate_iso(obj = ht,  output_rp = c(10, 100, 1000))
plot_ec(ec = iso_ts, raw_data = ww3_ts)

# Draw isodnesity contours using a wln fit on the peak data
wln = fit_wln(data = ww3_pk, npy = nrow(ww3_pk)/10)
iso_pk = estimate_iso(obj = wln,  output_rp = c(1, 2, 5))
plot_ec(ec = iso_pk, raw_data = ww3_pk)
