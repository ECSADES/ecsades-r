\title{ecsades: Environmental contours for safe design of ships and other marine structures}
\description{

}
\details{
This package contains functions to fit joint probability distributions to bivariate wave data (wave height and 
wave period), estimate environmental contours based on the fitted distribution or directly on a given sample 
data, output the coordinates of the vertices of the contours, and generate a plot of the contours.

The choices for the joint probability distributions include the Heffernan-Tawn model \code{\link{fit_ht}} and
the Weibull-log-normal distribution \code{\link{fit_wln}}. The choices for the environmental contours are the
direct sampling contours \code{\link{estimate_dsc}}, IFORM
contours \code{\link{estimate_iform}}, generalised joint exceedance contours \code{\link{estimate_gje}}, and the
isodensity contours \code{\link{estimate_iso}}.

This package has been developed as part of the
\href{https://www.dnvgl.com/technology-innovation/sri/maritime-transport/ecsades-project.html}{ECSADES} project
and is free to use. The
statistical models and contour estimation methods included in this package are discussed in detail in the project
paper Ross et al. (2018).

# Load sample data from NOAA's WaveWatch III project
data(ww3_pk)

# Fit the Heffernan-Tawn model to the data
ht = fit_ht(
  data = ww3_pk,
  npy = nrow(ww3_pk)/10,
  margin_thresh_count = 100,
  dep_thresh_count = 100)

# Estimate the DSC contours using the Hs return levels as 
dsc = estimate_dsc(jdistr = ht,  output_rp = c(1,10,100))
  
# Plot output and save to a file
plot_ec(
  ec = dsc, raw_data = ww3_pk, hs_x = FALSE, save_to_file = "dsc_ht.png",
  width = 6, height = 6, units = "in")
